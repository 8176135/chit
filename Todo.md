# Todo

## Now
  - re organise the code:
    - to more files
    - smaller functions
    - separate requests for crate and owner
  - What are the downloads over time?
  - Should i use this crate? 
  - How mature is it? <Star rating>

## Later if i need it
  - use `clap` to make this a real cmd tool
